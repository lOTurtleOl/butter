            <h2>No margarine for error</h2>
            <p>The history of margarine itself dates back to the 19th century when it was created as a cheaper
                alternative to butter. Initially made from animal fats, margarine evolved into a product primarily
                derived from vegetable oils. The name "margarine" comes from the Greek word "margarites," meaning pearl,
                due to its pearl-like luster.</p>

            <h2>Spreading joy since 1981</h2>
            <p> The spread is made from a blend of vegetable oils, water, and other ingredients, often including salt,
                flavorings, and emulsifiers. It undergoes a process called hydrogenation, which converts the liquid
                vegetable oils into a solid form, giving it a butter-like consistency.</p>

            <h2>The best thing to happen to the 80s</h2>
            <p>Since blowing minds(and not arteries) is what we do best, we've expanded our product line many times to
                include light versions with lower fat content, various flavors, and even a spray to enhance your
                favorite movie night.</p>
